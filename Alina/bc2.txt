''' for making a bot to make send messages we make a function named on_message, this is only the name for the defination as this library looks only for this function name to exicute the code.

 to detect the message to reply we use message.content.startswith(*the message*). 
to send the message in the channel in the server, we use await message.channel.send(*message*)'''
